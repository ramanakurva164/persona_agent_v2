Title: Login Failure - Invalid Credentials
Summary: Users cannot sign in — they receive an “invalid username or password” error.
Steps:
1. Ask user to confirm username/email and try password reset using the "Forgot password" link.
2. If password reset fails, check whether the user's account is locked due to repeated failed attempts (unlock policy: 15 minutes).
3. Verify account status in admin console (active, disabled, pending verification).
4. If social login used (Google / Apple), confirm OAuth provider connectivity and tokens.
Possible causes:
- Wrong password or username
- Account locked after multiple failed attempts
- Social login token expired or OAuth misconfiguration
