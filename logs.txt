[2025-11-03 16:45:53.941339] Ramana (frustrated user): I can’t log in again! It says invalid password even though it’s correct
Bot: 💡 *Friendly Help:* I totally understand how that feels. **Slow Page Load / High Latency**

**Summary:** Users report pages or dashboard loading slowly.

**Recommended Steps:**
1. Get user location, browser, and timestamp of slowness.
2. Check CDN and app server latency metrics and recent scaling events.
3. Suggest simple client fixes: clear cache, disable extensions, try incognito.
4. If server-side, scale up workers or optimize queries; advise Engineering on hotspots.

**Possible Causes:**
- side, scale up workers or optimize queries; advise Engineering on hotspots.
- Database slow queries, cache misses, overloaded app instances
- Large client-side assets or third-party scripts
We’ll fix this together!

[2025-11-03 16:55:52.674095] Ramana (general user): Login Failure - Invalid Credentials
Bot: 🙂 *General Help:* **Login Failure - Invalid Credentials**

**Summary:** Users cannot sign in — they receive an “invalid username or password” error.

**Recommended Steps:**
1. Ask user to confirm username/email and try password reset using the "Forgot password" link.
2. If password reset fails, check whether the user's account is locked due to repeated failed attempts (unlock policy: 15 minutes).
3. Verify account status in admin console (active, disabled, pending verification).
4. If social login used (Google / Apple), confirm OAuth provider connectivity and tokens.

**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid Credentials
- Wrong password or username
- Account locked after multiple failed attempts
- Social login token expired or OAuth misconfiguration
- login
